## Product Summary:

What is a 3D Printer? It might sound a little “woo-woo” to you because honestly – the technology does entail a bit of magic. A 3D Printer is basically a highly intelligent hot glue gun. It’s a robot that melts materials (called filaments) and turns it into whatever shape you tell it to, with your design software.  If you can design it, you can make it. Think prototypes, cosplay, pieces and segments of discontinued items, medical assistive devices, jigs and guides, the sky’s the limit! 3D printed prototypes are a part of many manufacturing processes. You can print (almost) anything you can imagine. Layer by layer. Minute by minute. You can make things on a 3D printer that you could never CNC, because nothing is cut. It can also integrate seamlessly into a partnership with your CNC because they both run on Makerverse. They can work beautifully together while creating art, furniture, gifts and so much more.
